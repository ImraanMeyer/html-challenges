      <h1>The Best Chicken Pasta Ever!</h1>

      <!-- paragraph introducing my favourite food -->
      <p>
          This is my ultimately favourite dish, espically
          the way my mother makes it. Nothings better than
          a mothers touch.
      </p>

      <p>
        Heat a little oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat.
      </p>

      <p>
        Add the onion and garlic and cook for about for 5 minutes until just softened.
        Turn up the heat, add a little more oil and then add the <em><strong>chicken</strong></em>.
        Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until browned all over.
        Stir in the chopped tomatoes, water, tomato purée, crème fraiche, sugar and basil.
        Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and simmer gently, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, cook the pasta according to the packet instructions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Preheat the grill to high.
      </p>


      <p>
        Drain the <em><strong>pasta</strong></em> and stir into the chicken and tomato sauce.
        Transfer to a shallow heatproof dish and sprinkle over the chopped mozzarella.
        Place under the grill until the <em><strong>cheese</strong></em> is golden and bubbling –
        this should take about 5 minutes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Garnish with basil leaves and serve with a baby kale salad.

      <p>
        The finshed product is so magnificent to look at it.
      </p>

      <p>
        The smell of the cheese which is melted all over the dish is divine, the
        taste of the creamy mushroom sauce is even better!
